<h2>Future areas to focus on</h2>

As this was a beginner course in JavaScript, I did not have the opportunity to explore building my own responsive navigation menu which I hoped for. This is still a goal. However I did find a way to use JavaScript to automatically set an active class to the active menu item page dynamically. I am pretty happy with where the JavaScript implementation ended up.
