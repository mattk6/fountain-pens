      <h2>My Collection</h2>
      <p>Currently my personal preferences include fountain pens with piston ink filling mechanisms, as well as other pens that do not contain cartridge converters. The fine nib is my preference which best matches up with my handwriting size.
      </p>
      <p>At right is a photo of my current collection. Enjoy reading about these pens I have below.<br><br>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-2000/" target="_blank">LAMY 2000</a> is a marvel of German engineering. With a modern yet timeless design, it's hard to tell it was first sold in 1966. The design remains largely unchanged and is widely recommended as a great first gold nib pen. This was the very first fountain pen that I wanted, and it was given to me as a confirmation present.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I really appreciate about the LAMY 2000 is that it has a fine gold nib, it is described as buttery smooth, and it utilizes a piston filling mechanism. When holding this pen in the hand, it is very well weighted and provides the feeling of holding a high-quality instrument. <br><br>
      </p>

      <div class="bg-logotwsbi"></div>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.twsbi.com/products/twsbi-diamond-580-clear-fountain-pen" target="_blank">Twsbi Diamond 580</a> is TWSBI's flagship pen. The TWSBI brand is well known for it's affordable clear-bodied demonstrator pens, with unique filling systems that can only be found on other brands' more expensive models. The Diamond series pens are applauded for their premium feel, design, and writing experience at one of the most competitive prices on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Twisby caught my eye because it is a quality piston filling pen with a modest price tag. I bought the diamond 580 model in burgundy. Something that is nice about this pen is that you are able to see the ink straight through the clear pen body. <br><br>
      </p>

      <div class="bg-logoparker"></div>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.parkerpen.com/parker-51-pens.html" target="_blank">Parker 51</a> is the top selling fountain pen of all time and were manufactured in England. While today it's considered vintage, it remains one of the best every day carry workhorse pens as it was designed with practicality in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I really like about the Parker 51 is that the nib is hooded which is what makes this model so iconic. This pen has an aerometric filling system. <br><br>
      </p>

        <h2>Economical pens</h2>
        <p>
        I have a few cheap fountain pens that are very economically priced and handy to carry around. These include the <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/all-jinhao-products/products/jinhao-993-shark-fountain-pen-dark-blue#" target="_blank">Jinhao Shark</a>, <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/all-jinhao-products/products/jinhao-x450-fountain-pen-frosted-black#" target="_blank">Jinhao x450</a>, <a href="https://platinumpenusa.com/whats-new/prefounte-fountain-pens/" target="_blank">Platinum prefounte</a>, and <a href="https://platinumpenusa.com/preppy-fountain-pen/" target="_blank">Platinum preppy</a>. Out of all of these, I would recommend the Platinum Prefounte, as it is not leaky and has a smooth nib. In my experience, writing with the Jinhao can be scratchy. I did try out the <a href="https://www.pilotpen.us/categories/fountain-pens/varsity/" target="_blank">Pilot Varsity</a> fountain pen when we filled out the self-registration card at the Colorado Pen Show. Even though this pen felt really light, and it is very inexpensive, it was surprisingly smooth to write with, therefore I thought to mention it here.
      </p>

      <h2>My Inks</h2><br>
      <div class="bg-logowaterman"></div>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.waterman.com/inks/ink-bottles/ink-bottle/SAP_S0110720.html" target="_blank">Waterman serenity blue</a> - The serenity blue is a nice color that won't ruin any pens and doesn't stain fabrics and surfaces like permanent inks do.  This ink can be used in any vintage or modern pen because it is not pigmented and will not damage the barrel/sack nor the nib. <br><br>
      </p>
      <div class="bg-logonoodlers"></div>
      <p>
        <a href="https://noodlersink.com/product/19083-american-aristocracy/" target="_blank">Noodler's American Aristocracy</a> (brownish purple)- Noodlerâ€™s inks are the most affordable inks by volume available. Known for variety and affordability, every bottle comes from a handmade batch made by the mad ink scientist Nathan Tardif. This is a fast-drying permanent ink which I commonly use in the cheap pens.
      </p>
      <h2>Supplies & Wish List</h2>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to investing in some fountain pen paper notebooks and stationery as both the Lamy and Twsbi release a water-based ink, that with everyday paper easily results in bleeding and/or feathering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blotting paper and a blotter is also on the list because the Waterman ink is not fast drying.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pen case is a really good idea to protect the pen regardless if you carry it in a pocket or have it in a backpack or other type of tote.
