        <h2>Penmanship</h2>
        <img src="myhand.jpeg" alt="My Hand Posture" width=375>
        <p>Even though I learned some cursive starting in the first grade, my handwriting mastery is imperfect. So how would someone who canâ€™t write neatly or legibly have such an interest in fountain pens? Pens are fascinating to me because each pen has its own properties, they take refillable ink, and are eco-friendly.</p>
        <p>As someone with Dysgraphia, regular writing utensils require extra effort to write text that is readable. Fountain pens write under their own weight and their typically larger barrel is easy to grip. All of these properties of fountain pens can improve the legibility of handwriting.</p>
        <p>I have become motivated to improve my ability in handwriting. There are helpful videos on this topic from my favorite sources below.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To7H-ZJ_8Ic" target="_blank">5 Tips to Improve Your Handwriting with Fountain Pens - YouTube</a>
        <ol>
          <li>Invest time in discovering what works for you. Try an extra fine nib for tiny writing. Try a medium broad nib for larger writing. Use flex nibs for cursive, or a stub/parallel nib</li>
          <li>Relax the hand and release pressure. Using a flex nib is the only time to use pressure.</li>
          <li>Write slowly to avoid railroading, skipping, and smearing. Apply technique that matches the ink.</li>
          <li>Draw inspiration from others. (Pinterest, or better yet <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=caligraphy" target="_blank">Etsy</a>?)</li>
          <li>Practice to progress to gain more confidence and skill. </li>

        <h2>Spencerian Handwriting</h2>
        <img src="spenceriansample.jpeg" alt="Sample of Spencerian Script" width= 375>
        <p>An eventual goal sometime in my lifetime will be to write Spencerian style, which became the standard business writing technique between 1850 and 1925.</p>
