<h2>About</h2>
The idea for Matthew's Fountain Pens started at the beginning of my CWB 1010 Intro to Web Development course. It has gone through a few different updates that are reflected in respective branches with applied coursework specific to both JavaScript and PHP. The main branch provides a reflection of everything I applied across the different courses.
