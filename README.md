<h1 align="center">Matthew's Fountain Pens with HTML & CSS</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>This branch represents the work I learned and applied as a result of taking CWB 1010 Introduction to Web Development.</strong>
<br/>
<h2>About</h2>
Prior to this class, I had not made a web page. My previous experience included downloading some pages with JavaScript that I found interesting. I would edit the scripts and/or html to see how adjustments affected various outcomes.    

<h2>Technologies</h2>
For CWB 1010 Intro to Web Development, we focused on learning HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

The assignment for the final was to create an original web site from scratch that is both accessible and appealing with original content.

Requirements for this project were to include navigation, a common header, 6 pages with original content. All to be styled with external CSS and consisting of the following:
<ul>
<li> 3 pages with images</li>
<li> 1 additional page with original multimedia</li>
<li> 1 additional page with embedded multimedia content</li>
<li> 1 additional page containing a form</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills Acquired</h2>

- CSS Styling
- Making html pages accessible
- Color coordination
- Making responsive pages according to screen size
- Proper usage of html tags
- Introductory JavaScript with dynamic content in the footer

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Download this project as zip and extract it
2. Within the console (Terminal Window), make sure PHP is installed, then open the project root folder and run:
   ```
    php -S localhost:3000
   ```
3. In the browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

<h2>Future areas to focus on</h2>

During class I found having the navigation list copied into every page to be redundant, and because of it making updates to the nav menu was tedious. In addition removing a lot of copy and paste for the menu, I also want to look into a responsive menu option that displays a hamburger when switching to a smaller window size. I am hopeful that with a future class in JavaScript, I'll learn the skills to develop my own solution that enables a hamburger menu with smaller screens.
