        <h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Wheather cleaning a pen for long term storage, regular maintenance, or even an ink change, making sure a pen is clean is an important part of preserving a fountain pen.
        </p>

        <h3>Pen Maintenance Supplies</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Water.</b> Most pens will be fine with tap water, but higher priced or vintage pens might be sensitive to mineral deposits, so some people use distilled water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pen flush.</b> Pen Flush is useful to get rid of ink buildup in your pen. Homemade pen flush is roughly 1 part ammonia to 10 parts water and 2 drops of Dawn brand Dish soap; Otherwise you can buy mass produced flush such as Goulet's Pen Flush.
            <br>
            While use of pen flush is not strictly necessary, If you do use it, draw it into the pen or converter, soak, and then rinse with plain water repeatedly to insure all the cleaning solution is gone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bulb Syringe.</b> This is useful for cleaning out and rinsing grip sections/nib units.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pure Silicone Grease.</b> If you have a sticky piston or converter, silicone grease is the answer. You can buy this from Goulet for $3.00 or, if you've purchased a TWSBI, you get a vial of it with the pen. Make sure it is 100% pure silicone, as some chemicals in non-pure silicone grease can potentially damage some pens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Toothpicks.</b> A toothpick makes it easier to apply silicone grease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Q-Tips.</b> Only use these for wiping the inside of pen caps; As fibers can fall off, and get stuck in barrel of nib.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Towel.</b> Paper towel, or dedicated cloth towel, as it will get hard-to-remove ink stains.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cleaning & Filling Procedures</h3>

        <h4>Piston pen:</h4>
        <p>
          Piston pens are easy and fun to fill, especially the clear-bodied TWSBI-style pens, but getting them completely empty of ink can be difficult. Turn the piston to empty the ink. Fill a bowl with water and insert the nib up to the grip section. Then cycle between filling and emptying the the pen with water until the the water coming from the pen runs clear. Let dry on towel.

        <h4>Eyedropper pen:</h4>
        <p>
          An Eyedropper is considered the hardest pen to fill, and the easiest to clean. Just unscrew the nib, empty the ink, and rinse the barrel thoroughly. Put the nib unit under running, room-temperature tap water to rinse out the bulk of the ink. Then use the bulb syringe to <b>gently</b> finish cleansing the nib unit. Before reasembling the pen, apply a small amount of silicone grease to threads of the barrel to prevent leakage. Finally, let the pen dry on a towel and reasemble the pen.<br>Note: some friction-fit nibs might pop out of the pen if too much pressure is applied on the bulb syringe.
        </p>

        <h4>Cartrige/converter pen:</h4>
        <p>Cartrige/Converters are the most popular category of fountain pen. Cartriges are interchangable tubes of ink that hold 0.8ml of ink. A converter fits into a cartrige slot, and allows for bottled ink to be used. However, a converter only holds between 0.6ml and 1ml of ink, and might not fit in every pen.</p>
        <p>
          Cartride Replacement: Unscrew the grip section from the body of the pen and dispose of the cartrige. Put the nib unit under running, room-temperature tap water to rinse out the bulk of the ink. Then use the bulb syringe to clean the nib unit. Let dry on towel and reassemble the pen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Converter Maintenance: Unscrew the grip section from the body of the pen and remove converter. Put the nib unit under running, room-temperature tap water to rinse out the bulk of the ink. Then use the bulb syringe to clean the nib unit. Then, empty the cartrige and then rinse it out by filling it with clean water and emptying repeatedly until water comes out the converter clear. Let dry on towel and reassemble the pen
        </p>

        <h4>Vacuum pen:</h4>

        <p>
          Vacuum pens are the hardest to <a target="_blank" href="https://goldspot.com/pages/how-to-clean-a-fountain-pen">completely clean</a>, and are the least common nonproprietary fill type. The usual cleaning advice for the vacuum filler is to fill with flush, gently shake the pen a bit, empty the flush, and repeat with water a few times.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Caps
        </h4>
        <p>
          Fountain pens are prone to leak when shook, or during altitude and pressure changes. The cap might get inky, so it is considered good practice to rinse out the pen cap and use a Q-tip to wipe out the rest of the ink. Then let dry upright on a towel.
