            <p>There are a number of probable reasons why people have shy away from fountain pens, including: </p>
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>Assumptions that any fountain pen is expensive</li>
              <li>Ballpoint pens are much more convenient</li>
              <li>If they don't click, they are not dependable</li>

      <p><sup>1 </sup>In my personal experience, the Pilot Varsity never fails, it writes smoothly, and does not skip. 
      It is my top recommendation at its very economical price. The only downside is that it’s not designed to be refilled, 
      however it can be done.<br>
      <sup>2 </sup>The month old Preppy in my possession regularly has to be primed on scratch paper before ink starts flowing,
      which is frustrating It also skips a lot, therefore I have given it 3 stars.<br>
      <sup>3 </sup>The Prefounte has the same feed and nib as the preppy, and every part is interchangeable, however it comes 
      in classier colors and has a metal clip instead of the preppy’s plastic one. This model pen might get better Quality Control, 
      because I haven’t had any problems with it.</p>
